Coop Simulator

First of all we need to understand requirements of the rabbit coop simulation. 
We have rabbits in the coop and females give birth for a specific period of time. 
We want to calculate count of all rabbits in the coop in a specific time.

What we need to know at the beggining of the simulation;
* initial state of the coop about how many male and female rabbits 
* female rabbits give birth at certain intervals
* female rabbits give birth to a certain age
* how many rabbit can live in a coop (maximum population)
* user simulation cycle. Specific time period (monthly precision)

Output should include;
* Number of male / female rabbits
* rabbits age at a given time

Implementation Plan
I am going to create a configuration file which include all initial requirements for the simulation.
{
  "animals": [
    {
      "name": "Rabbit",
      "femaleBirthAtMonth": 3,
      "femaleBirthAgeAtMonth": 36,
      "femaleNumberOfBirth": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "Chicken",
      "femaleBirthAtMonth": 1,
      "femaleBirthAgeAtMonth": 25,
      "femaleNumberOfBirth": 5
    }
  ],
  "coop": {
    "initialStates": [
      {
        "animalName": "Rabbit",
        "females": [
          {
            "Age": 3
          }
        ],
        "males": [
          {
            "Age": 3
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "animalName": "Chicken",
        "females": [
          {
            "Age": 2
          }
        ],
        "males": [
          {
            "Age": 2
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "maxPopulation": 500
  },
  "cyclePeriodAtMonth": 4
}

Secondly, we need to create concrete class for entity.
We need Animal class and Coop class.

Thirtly, We need a business layer to process simulation

I am going to use.Net Core 3.1 Console Application for implementation
I will also use BenchmarkDotNet for simulation performance 
I am going to create an appsetting.json as configuration file in order to get simulation requirements.
